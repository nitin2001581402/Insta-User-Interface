# Insta User Interface

This Insta-UI project replicates the core Instagram Stories feature as part of a modern social web app, built with Next.js and TypeScript.

Users can view stories, tap right to move forward, tap left to go back, and see loading indicators showing story progress. The app tracks who viewed each story during the session using Session Storage.
